SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, is concerned about customer churn, where customers stop using their services. To address this, the company has gathered data on customer behavior to identify those likely to leave and implement strategies to retain them, as losing customers is costly.

The term “**churn**” refers to customers leaving the company, and the current churn rate is approximately 14%. Aiming to reduce this rate to about 7%.

The project utilized the provided dataset to address key questions:

- Identifying the main features that determine customer churn
- Uncovering any predictable patterns
- Exploring how SyriaTel can leverage these insights to implement cost-effective solutions.

The project aims to develop a classification model to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Following the CRISP-DM methodology, the project involves six stages: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover patterns and factors driving customer churn and create a predictive model to help reduce customer attrition.

# I: Business Understanding
