    "SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, is concerned about customer churn, where customers stop using their services. To address this, the company has gathered data on customer behavior to identify those likely to leave and implement strategies to retain them, as losing customers is costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims to develop a classification model to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Following the CRISP-DM methodology, the project involves six stages: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover patterns and factors driving customer churn and create a predictive model to help reduce customer attrition."

    "- Identify key factors leading to customer churn.\n",
    "- Develop an accurate churn prediction model.\n",
    "- Implement strategies to retain at-risk customers.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Achieving a recall score of 0.8 with the prediction model.\n",
    "- Identifying significant features contributing to churn.\n",
    "- Providing actionable recommendations to reduce churn and enhance retention.\n",
    "- Demonstrating the value of proactive retention strategies in reducing revenue losses."
